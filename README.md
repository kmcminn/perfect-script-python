Perfect Script (python)
=====================
a template for the (soon to be) perfect python script


## Todo
Finishing perfect script in [ruby](https://github.com/kmcminn/perfect-script-ruby) I'm doing the same with python. Still thinking it through.

* Structure: to class or not!
* Think more about complext scripting and reuse with python
* sys.exit on the return result of the entry point?
* consider docstrings and pep8
* convert to argparse
* test python3
* should script be compatible from pythong 2.6 - 3.2?
